# Bootstrap-portfolio

## Description 
For this challenge I had to make a Bootsrtap portfolio.

Firstly, I started by building my HTML structure and then edited CSS. Most of the time I work with Microsoft Edge browser and unfortnutely not all changes show on Google Chrome browser. I've had many challenges with the structure of the page and how all cards align, as it responds differently in every browser.
